## Minecraft Mappings
- Still seems slower compared to vanilla Fabric on dev session, but is workable for now.
- Might need more jank to integrate with vanilla mixin?
- You get 2 and 3 for the mapped method name, which is workable but still feels a bit weird.
- No Javadoc (https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Mappings/issues/1), especially useful on block classes.
